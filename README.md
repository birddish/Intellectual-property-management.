# Chapter 1: Governance as the Core Enterprise Intellectual Property Management Introduction

The current main technical solutions for internal intellectual property management within enterprises are mostly based on innovation management and compliance management. Taking the "Enterprise Intellectual Property Compliance Management System Requirements" (GB/T 29490-2023) as an example, it takes intellectual property compliance as a clue. Taking regulatory management as a clue, emphasizing legal compliance, it proposes a compliance management plan for intellectual property. Its main purpose is to promote the compliance management of enterprises in the field of intellectual property, while ISO56005 takes innovation management as a clue, emphasizing the promotion of innovation. In the process, an innovative management plan for intellectual property rights is proposed, whose main purpose is to promote enterprise innovation.
However, neither of them describes the intellectual property management system from the perspective of how intellectual property can support the strategic goals of the enterprise. This article takes governance as the core and proposes an A solution to achieve internal intellectual property management within an enterprise.

1. Overview of the intellectual property management process
ISO56005 adds the intellectual property management process to the innovation management process, and manages intellectual property based on the identification, creation, verification, development, and deployment processes of innovation management. In GB/T 29490-2023, the PDCA cycle is established on the premise of leadership support and is divided into modules such as leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, and improvement.
In this article, we refer to the NIST CSF 2.0 framework and integrate the technical solutions in GB/T 29490-2023 and ISO56005 to propose an intellectual property management based on each stage of the entire life cycle of intellectual property. Framework to realize our intellectual property management, including seven functions: governance, identification, protection, operation, monitoring, response, and recovery. Among them, governance establishes and monitors the organization's IP risk management strategies, expectations and policies and is cross-cutting and central to this framework.

Identification, including the identification of the intellectual property itself and the identification of intellectual property risks, helps determine the organization's current intellectual property assets and their risks ;
Protection, including the use of safeguards to prevent or reduce intellectual property risks;
Operations, including taking licensing, authorization and other measures to realize economic benefits of intellectual property;
Monitor, identify and analyze possible attacks and harms to our intellectual property;
Respond to, and take action on, detected IP incidents;
Recovery, restoring IP assets and operations affected by IP incidents.

2. The meaning of corporate intellectual property governance
Corporate IP governance refers to a set of corporate governance rules focused on intellectual property, its performance and risk management , consisting of leadership relationships, organizational structures and processes that ensure the management and monitoring of organizational regulatory, legal, risk, environmental and operational requirements The policies, procedures and processes are understood and informed, thereby building the enterprise's corporate intellectual property governance system to ensure that intellectual property rights can support the strategic goals of the organization .
The difference between governance and management is that governance authorizes, guides, empowers, supervises and restricts management behavior. Management should work within the constraints of organizational governance to achieve the organization's goals.
Governance has an indirect effect on what is managed. Governing something therefore involves indirect action and control that limits and expropriates resources. For example, the board of directors has indirect influence and control over the intellectual property department. The board of directors can "manage" intellectual property resources by setting policies and limiting what the R&D director can do.
The functions of governance and management will overlap. In many cases, it is impossible to distinguish whether an action or control mainly serves the purpose of governance or management, and there are a large number of actions and control services that belong to both governance and management. However, it is difficult to distinguish between these two economic functions. is beneficial and can satisfy both governance and management related needs.
Governance on the one hand provides outcomes for the other six functions to inform how the organization achieves and prioritizes the outcomes of the other six functions within the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. On the other hand, governance is also required through the other six functions.

3. Governance Principles of Enterprise Intellectual Property Management
In the process of establishing an enterprise intellectual property governance system, organizations should formulate documents and implement them, continuously improve and optimize them, and ensure the performance and compliance of intellectual property applications. Organizations should adhere to the following governance principles:
a) Corporate intellectual property governance is an integral part of corporate governance. The top decision-maker is the ultimate person responsible for corporate intellectual property governance, and the decision-making level is the corporate intellectual property governance subject; each governance subject can have the following responsibilities and duties: Comply with the overall governance of the organization The entity establishes goals, values, and principles; addresses stakeholder needs; complies with organizational and regulatory requirements; develops and maintains policies, procedures, and processes; sets goals and provides guidance for managed organizational entities; delegates responsibilities to managers, And provide empowerment and support: it is appropriate to balance the delegated powers and responsibilities according to behavioral needs, while the governance body still bears the ultimate responsibility; monitor the consistency and completion of the goals; provide final decisions on key issues that gradually escalate.
b) Establish an enterprise intellectual property management organization, whose members include at least internal supervision departments, important business departments and intellectual property departments; it should be recognized that enterprise intellectual property management is not a matter of a single company's legal affairs or an intellectual property department. All employees of the entire company should actively participate in the practice. Everyone should participate in intellectual property management activities and play a corresponding role in it.
c) Clarify risk preference and risk tolerance to prevent major financial and reputational losses, regulatory penalties, legal sanctions, etc. due to violations; risk preference and risk tolerance are the basis of risk assessment, which determine the measures that should be taken based on the identified risks. Which risk management method;
d) Ensure that stakeholders understand expected benefits, support intellectual property investment, and accept possible risks and countermeasures;
e) Establish strategies, systems, culture and innovation mechanisms for intellectual property application to support business model changes, technological progress and management improvements.
4. Governance model and framework of corporate intellectual property governance
4.1 Intellectual Property Governance Model
The enterprise intellectual property governance model includes the internal and external requirements of governance, governance subjects, governance methods, and the management system of intellectual property and its application, as shown in the following figure:
![image](https://github.com/birddish/Intellectual-property-management./assets/17795144/a4295328-e0da-44f8-846f-002c1e03c07b)

The above picture is adapted from GB/T 34960.1-2017
The governance body takes the organizational charter, regulatory responsibilities, stakeholder expectations, business pressure and business requirements as driving forces to establish a governance process of assessment, guidance, and supervision and clarify tasks.
The governance body should guide managers to improve the management system of intellectual property and its application through intellectual property governance strategies and policies, evaluate intellectual property-related plans and plans, and supervise the performance and compliance of intellectual property applications.
Organizations should combine governance principles and models to carry out self-supervision, self-evaluation and auditing during the implementation of corporate intellectual property governance, and make continuous improvements.
4.2 Intellectual Property Governance Framework
The intellectual property governance framework includes three major governance areas: intellectual property top-level design, management system, and resources. Each governance area consists of the following governance elements, as shown in Figure 2.
a) The top-level design governance domain includes intellectual property strategy, as well as the organization and structure that supports the strategy;
b) The management system governance domain includes intellectual property-related quality management, project management, investment management, service management, business continuity management, information security management, risk management, supplier management, asset management and other management;
c) The resource governance domain includes intellectual property-related infrastructure, application systems and data.

The above picture comes from GB/T 34960.1-2017

5. Governance of top-level design
5.1 Intellectual Property Governance Strategy
Intellectual property governance entities should guide, evaluate and supervise intellectual property strategies, clarify intellectual property strategic goals and continuously improve them. At least:
a) Assess the internal and external environment of information technology and formulate an information technology strategy that is consistent with the organizational strategy;
b) Guide and evaluate information technology plans and programs, and promote the continuous optimization and improvement of its management system;
c) Clarify requirements such as risk appetite, compliance, performance and auditing, and conduct evaluation and supervision.

5.1.1 Intellectual Property Governance Strategic Objectives
Similar to the approach taken to create a general or specific innovation strategy, an organization's intellectual property governance strategy is differentiated, depending on the organization's innovation strategy and business strategy, related to the goals of new products, services, processes, models, methods, etc.
developing an IP governance strategy is to integrate IP management into business and innovation governance strategies to achieve:
1. Ensure reasonable allocation of resources throughout the entire innovation process;
2. Establish strategic goals and related policies for intellectual property governance to ensure that the organization achieves its organizational goals and innovation goals; the strategic process will ensure effective management of innovation and improve innovation success rate, output and/or organizational performance;
3. Minimize intellectual property risks related to innovation activities and actions and ensure that the organization maintains ownership or accessibility of innovation outputs and/or results;
4. Optimize IP assets to maximize innovation efficiency, output and/or results (e.g., through monetization, commercialization, technology transfer, innovation partnerships, supply chain management or IP landscape analysis to optimize organizational positioning) );
5. Enhance organizational competitiveness through the use of intellectual property rights.

5.1.2 Intellectual property governance strategy formulation
In practice, during the designation process of intellectual property governance strategy, at least: a) Assess the internal and external environment of intellectual property and formulate an intellectual property governance strategy that is consistent with the organizational strategy;
b) Guide and evaluate intellectual property planning and programs, and promote the continuous optimization and improvement of its management system;
c) Clarify requirements such as risk appetite, compliance, performance and auditing, and conduct evaluation and supervision.
More specifically, in the process of formulating an intellectual property governance strategy, you can refer to the ISO56006 standard and carry out specific formulation with the following process:


5.1.3 Implementation of intellectual property governance strategy
Organizations should regularly assess and review their IP governance strategy in light of changes in the external environment or internal changes resulting from the evolution of the organization's strategy .
their IP governance strategy by considering the following factors :
—Examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with the organization’s intellectual property in the organizational context;
—Discover and review the organization’s key IP governance strategic objectives ;
— Understand how the IP governance strategy relates to the strategic direction of the organization;
— Define who is responsible for implementing the IP governance strategy and their responsibilities;
—Defining how to measure business impact;
—Defining a time frame;
—Understand the important considerations of an organization’s intellectual property policy.
If necessary, the organization should communicate its IP governance strategy to all relevant parties to achieve effective implementation. The organization should also develop tools and allocate the necessary resources to ensure that the IP governance strategy and IP management processes are appropriately implemented.
5.2 Organization
Enterprise intellectual property governance entities should guide, evaluate and supervise intellectual property organizational mechanisms and ensure the understanding and support of stakeholders.
At a minimum, it should: a) guide the establishment and improvement of the intellectual property organizational structure, clarify authorization, decision-making and communication mechanisms, and conduct evaluation and supervision;
b) Create an organizational culture suitable for corporate intellectual property governance; intellectual property governance is not just a matter for the intellectual property department or the legal department, but requires the full participation of all company personnel.
c) Improve personnel’s corporate intellectual property governance awareness and professional competence, and conduct relevant education and training on a regular basis.

5.3 Architecture
Enterprise intellectual property governance entities should guide, evaluate and supervise the technical structure of intellectual property governance to support the realization of strategic goals of intellectual property governance. Mainly refers to the application and support system established to meet the organization's intellectual property technology strategy, management system, and business development. It should at least:
a) Guide the establishment of the technical structure of intellectual property governance, and evaluate and supervise the planning, design, implementation, service and other processes; if based on the actual situation of the operation of multiple entities within the organization, it is clear that its intellectual property governance should adopt a centralized or decentralized approach It is also a governance technology structure that combines decentralization and centralization;
b) Assess changes in the internal and external environment for intellectual property development, and continuously improve the technical structure of intellectual property governance; for example, when a company merges with another, how to manage the two original independent intellectual property management departments is the key to the merger. Absorption, or parallel reporting.
c) Establish a management system that is compatible with the intellectual property governance structure, and conduct evaluation and continuous improvement.

6. Governance of the management system
6.1 The necessity and overview of management system governance
The governance body should guide managers to follow the plan, execute, check, improve (PDCA) method from the perspectives of completeness, effectiveness, suitability, compliance, cost-effectiveness and consistency, propose governance requirements for the intellectual property management system, and continuously Improve and optimize the intellectual property management system. An intellectual property management system should be established at least from multiple levels such as quality management, project management, investment management, service management, business continuity management, information security management , risk management, supply chain management, and intellectual property asset management. Subsequent content will be

7. Resource Management
7.1Overview _
The governance body should combine the overall intellectual property structure to establish a directory system of resources , propose governance requirements for intellectual property resources and their applications from the three levels of infrastructure, application systems and data, and conduct evaluation , guidance, supervision and improvement.

7.2Infrastructure _
Organizations should clarify governance requirements for the environment and underlying software associated with IP infrastructure. At a minimum it should :
a ) Develop infrastructure plans to support strategic development and meet business needs ; such as building the company's patent database in a targeted manner based on the company's future technological development direction to meet the company's future technical intelligence and intellectual property compliance areas in this direction. business needs and avoid compliance risks.
b ) Establish infrastructure construction, procurement, implementation and operation and maintenance mechanisms , and formulate corresponding management strategies and methods ; such as establishing a centralized intellectual property infrastructure procurement system to avoid duplication of intellectual property infrastructure construction among various entities within the organization and procurement to control costs.
c ) Evaluate, guide, supervise and improve infrastructure-related management mechanisms and service capabilities. For example, during the construction process, the infrastructure should be continuously managed and supervised, and the performance of the infrastructure should be assessed based on preset performance assessment methods to promote the improvement of the infrastructure.

7.3 Intellectual property application system
Organizations should clarify the governance requirements for intellectual property application system planning, design and development, integrated implementation, and operation and maintenance. At a minimum it should :
a ) Ensure that the application system planning meets the organizational strategy and business objectives , and evaluate and supervise the performance and compliance of the application system ; if the enterprise plans to build a patent information utilization system, the patent information utilization system should be based on the enterprise's existing and future research and development directions. Construct.
b ) Establish a guarantee mechanism for application system design, development, change and testing to ensure that functions, performance and security meet design requirements ; for example, when an enterprise builds an internal intellectual property asset management and audit system, it should implement an intellectual property asset management and audit system as much as possible Full coverage of enterprise intellectual property asset applications to reduce audit failures.
c ) Develop strategies, systems and guarantee mechanisms related to application system launch, migration, switching between old and new systems, emergency plans, etc .;
d ) Evaluate, guide, supervise and improve application system management mechanisms and service capabilities.

7.4Intellectual property data _
The intellectual property data here does not mainly refer to the data assets themselves as intellectual property, but refers to the relevant information that supports the entire intellectual property system of the organization, including but not limited to trade secrets, data assets, patent information, technical documents, work content, etc.
Data governance originates from the organization's external supervision, internal data management and application needs. Its purpose is to ensure operational compliance, risk control and value realization in the intellectual property data and its application process. Its demand sources mainly include:
a) Laws and regulations, industry supervision and internal control and other requirements for the security and compliance of data and its applications; for example, articles published by enterprises on their own WeChat public accounts should ensure that they do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.
b) Requirements for data productization, assetization and valueization; if an enterprise involves a technical solution for a certain product, the technical solution as data will be converted into an asset-based patent by applying for a patent;
c) Requirements for system construction such as data architecture, data model, data standards, data quality and data security during the data life cycle management and application process. For example, in the entire life cycle of intellectual property assets, through the data architecture of the mapping relationship between technical solutions and patent assets, a data model for patent protection of technical solutions is constructed.
Organizations should clarify data governance requirements , formulate data governance strategies , and clarify data governance tasks . At a minimum, they should :
a ) Construct a framework for data governance and determine the scope, enabling factors and environment of data governance ; such as clarifying the top-level design of data governance, data governance environment, data governance domain and data governance process.
b ) Establish a data governance organization and clarify the decision-making, authorization and control mechanisms of data governance ; focus on the responsible subjects and rights, obtain the understanding and support of stakeholders by improving the organizational mechanism, and formulate data management processes and systems to Support the implementation of data governance.
c ) Develop metadata specifications and data quality standards that meet business needs to ensure the uniqueness, authority and validity of data ; the scope and priority of metadata management should be clarified, strategies and processes for metadata management should be established, and metadata development should be carried out Create, store, integrate and control, etc., and continuously improve and optimize;
d ) Establish data security, privacy, compliance and other guarantee mechanisms , clarify the scope of data use, responsibilities and rights and other relevant requirements ; should formulate data security management objectives, guidelines and strategies, establish a data security system, implement data security control, and continuously improve Data security management capabilities.
e ) Establish a data life cycle management and service capability system , and conduct evaluation, guidance, supervision and improvement ; the data life cycle should be defined and corresponding management strategies should be formulated for different stages to reduce costs and risks and support data resource management and Data asset operations .
